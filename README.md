# Neurosity

## Neurosity Github repositories:
- https://github.com/neurosity/app-hello-world-notion-js/blob/master/index.js (most basic code they have where users can start from scratch)
- https://github.com/neurosity/neurosity-sdk-js (detailed version)

This code started from app-hello-world-notion-js and just made lists to save values to a .json file. I used https://docs.neurosity.co/docs/tutorials/your-first-node-app/#npm, so if you want to start from scratch, start here.
